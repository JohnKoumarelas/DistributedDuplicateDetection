# DistributedDuplicateDetection
This repository will serve as the central repository, including common classes, for the project seminar of Distributed Duplicate Detection held at the Hasso Plattner Institute during the Winter Semester 2016-2017.

Such classes include:
* Interfaces that the group of students have to implement.
* Brute force solution as an example.
* Evaluation classes to test the implementations.
* Possibly some UnitTests.
